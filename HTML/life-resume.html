<h1>LIFE RESUME*</h1>
<p>*This page reads better as a 'Life Resume' than an FAQ. Hope you find it entertaining nonetheless!</p>

<p>Oh look! You found me here. <br>You probably want to start on the <a href="http://www.ryandrake.com/about" class="link">'About' page</a> before reading further...</p>

<strong>Full name:</strong> Ryan Anthony Drake
<strong>Age:</strong> 20
<strong>Current Location:</strong> Brisbane, Australia
<strong>Nationality:</strong> Dual Australian/UK Citizen

<strong>Education:</strong>
<p>2007-2011: Attended Brisbane Boys' College. </p>
<p><em>Played rugby, football, chess, water polo and was involved in choir over the years. Finished as Vice Captain of the school.</em></p>
<p>2012: Got seriously bored at University of Queensland.
<p><em>Decided politics wasn't for me, and I was going to become a shitload richer than my boring business lecturers. Dropped out at the end of the year.</em></p>
<p>July - September 2013: Moved to Sydney to study software development at <a class="link" href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>.</p>
<p><em>Turned out to be the best decision of my life. Led to front-end developer position at <a class="link" href="http://otherlevels.com" target="_blank">OtherLevels</a>, which I'm still working for 13 months later. Has given me the opportunity to travel and work on developing a product I love. Honestly, I've learnt more in the last six months at my job than I would have four years at university.</em></p>

<strong>Achievements/Awards/Accolades:</strong>
<p>2010: Volunteered at U2 concert. Got free ticket to front of stage and taste Bono's sweat as he is so close, it's flying off him as he sings.</p>
<p>2011: Trained by Al Gore in Jakarta, Indonesia to become a <a href="http://climaterealityproject.org/" target="_blank">Climate Reality Project</a> presenter.</p>
<p>2011: <a href="http://www.adflongtanawards.gov.au/" target="_blank">Long Tan Youth Leadership Award</a> Recipient
<em>This was received due to the different leadership roles I held during high school. Was a huge honour to receive this, along with the $500 bounty! That's a lot of money when you're a broke student.</em>
<p>2014: World Vision Youth Campaigner</p>
<em>A year-long project working alongside some other girls to develop an entirely youth-run campaign called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VGenAustralia" class="link">#FreeTo</a>, raising awareness of child rights issues in south-east Asia.</em>
<img src="http://ryandrake.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vgen1.jpg" width="550" height="550" class="aligncenter" />
<p>2014: Received my CrossFit Level 1 Certificate</p>
<em>I truly wanted to learn more about the CrossFit methodology and philosophy, so decided to take the training course. Hopefully, it may come in good use in the future if I decide to coach others personally.</em>

<strong>Dating Experience:</strong>
<p>2005: Made a website for Cute Girl I liked when I was 10.</p>
<p><em>Realized several years later that it was superrr creepy, and that isn't probably how you show affection for a girl in Grade 5.</em></p>
<p>December 2008: Rode a bike to drop off gift at Cute Girl's house on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><em>So happened to keep in touch with Cute Girl and thought I had a chance now that I was 4 years older. No chance. I went and got her some of her favourite chocolate, Lush and Body Shop products + a friendship stone! Then, knowing she was away, rode a bike to her house and dropped it off on her doorstep. Only got one text of appreciation, thus decided to give up on Cute Girl forevermore.</em></p>
<p>September 2009 - December 2009: Liking two girls at once means you lose.</p>
<p><em>I moved to France for five months. I ended up liking two completely different girls (both in terms of personality and looks) who just so happened to not like each other. At all! So, when one of them was not talking to me, I'd talk to the other one. It just so happened that both of them liked me for different periods whilst I was living in France! I only found out when they had the courage to tell me before I left...*sad face*</em></p>
<p>2010: Invisible person.</p>
<p><em>I liked a few girls in high school but too hopelessly insecure, shy and freakin' weird to ever do anything about it. Had zero game. Nothing happened this year.</em></p>
<p>February 2011 - July 2011: Kinda-sorta had my first not official 'girlfriend'.</p>
<p><em>Honestly fell hard for this girl. First kiss with her - under the moonlight on Friday, February 18! Was never 'official' because we weren't really supposed to date. So we sort of just stayed as 'more than friends', but known as my girlfriend to friends. I f**ked things up by just being insecure and not ever believing someone as gorgeous as her could ever like me. When it ended, took me a freaking long time to get over her as I lost my best friend. Unfortunately, we aren't friends anymore. </em></p>
<p>August 2011 - January 2012: Super sad.</p>
<p><em>Still hung up on Unofficial Girlfriend #1. Took me a long time to get over it emotionally. I did reaaaally love her. Oh well. Finally come to my senses that there was no chance of anything ever happening again. Picked up my sorry ass off the floor and decided to move on.</em></p>
<p>February 2012 - Present: Single Pringle. Riding solo.</p>
<p><em>Been really working on improving myself and working on accelerating my success as I strive towards achieving my personal and professional goals. In between work, friends, family commitments and training, I don't have a lot of free time and I'm not interested in dating just for the sake of it/one night stands. <strong>Found out Tinder is **definitely** not for me.</strong> So we shall see what happens in 2015!</em></p>

<h2 class="center-content">Personal Growth</h2>
<strong>What do you like to read about?</strong>

I love to read non-fiction primarily these days, as I am constantly striving to learn new skills and acquire knowledge about topics unknown to me previously. Otherwise, I enjoy reading historical fiction as a means to unwind after a long day.

<h2 class="center-content">Wellness</h2>
<strong>What sport or activities did you participate in whilst you were younger?</strong>
<p>I've participated in a number of different sports over the years. I was particularly fond of rugby throughout primary and high school, and loved water polo when I was younger. I loved volleyball and football. I've also tried fencing, ping pong and ice skating for a season.

I enjoyed chess and debating, but people argue whether those count as sports...perhaps mental sports?!

<strong>What supplements do you take?</strong>

I take a number of different supplements, including the following:
<ul>
	<li>Krill Oil</li>
	<li>Greens Superfood Blend</li>
	<li>Vitamin D3</li>
	<li>Magnesium Powder</li>
	<li>Men's Daily Multi-Vitamin</li>
	<li>Pre-workout with Caffeine</li>
	<li>Whey Protein Isolate</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="center-content">Adventure</h2>
<strong>What countries have you travelled to?</strong>

<p>I've visited a total of 22 countries so far! The countries I've visited so far are England, France, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Solomon Islands, New Zealand, Fiji, United States, Egypt and South Africa.

My next holiday will be to India for three weeks in January 2015 with my Dad. We'll be travelling around the northern part of India. Cannot wait!

<strong>What has been the most adventurous thing you have done?</strong>
<p>I went bungee jumping in Taupo, New Zealand when I was 14 years old! I seriously wish I had the photo still, but it's only motivation to go again! I found it more terrifying to watch others jump than to jump myself. It's the feeling of weightlessness at the beginning where you really feel as though you have no life support, that you're going to die before falling vertically and feeling the rush of the wind in your lungs! So exhilarating.</p>
